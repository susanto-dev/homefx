# Complete project backlog

Status at the 0.13 development batch (video add-on 0.13.0, repository add-on 0.2.0). **Implemented** means source and automated
checks exist; it never means tested on the TV or against a real account.
**Mocked/inactive** means service/player code is not wired into Kodi. **Pending**
means work or external evidence is still required. **Decision** needs a product,
provider or release choice. The current public add-on remains synthetic.

## Browsing and personal library

| ID | Item | Status | Remaining work / acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| B01 | Single repository, video add-on, Kodi 21 Python manifest | Implemented | Actual Android/Google TV compatibility pending |
| B02 | Multiple selected list widgets and folder browsing | Implemented in demo | Choose actual personal/liked lists; live wiring and widget-title click behavior need TV verification |
| B03 | Episode/season browser, watched counts, aired-unwatched filter | Implemented in demo; complete-series/season summaries mocked (0.10) | Live episode identity/status and refresh behavior |
| B04 | Continue watching, unfinished first, next aired unwatched | Implemented in demo; bounded series joins, continuation candidates and enriched paused metadata mocked (0.11) | Live metadata, resume reconciliation and performance |
| B05 | Save movies including unreleased titles, upcoming view | Implemented locally; Trakt list-add mocked | Live owned-list selection/write outcomes; regional release semantics |
| B06 | Manual mark watched | Implemented locally; remote add-history mocked | Explicit live writes and uncertain-result reconciliation; remote unwatched/history deletion needs separate semantics |
| B07 | Title search | Demo implemented; Trakt title-search contracts mocked/inactive (0.9) | Live literal-query behavior, entitlement, keyboard/context-menu UI and TV integration |
| B08 | Similar movies | Demo implemented; Trakt related-movie contracts mocked/inactive (0.9) | Live relevance and UI integration; results establish neither watch state nor playable sources |
| B09 | Release dates and sorting | Provisional rules implemented | Choose movie region/release type and confirm ordering; dates never prove source availability |
| B10 | Skin and home layout | Existing skin retained | TV navigation/focus/widget headers; separate skin only if demonstrated necessary |
| B11 | Upcoming personal episode calendar | Mocked/inactive (0.11) | Confirm live personal-calendar coverage and entitlement; a selected-show filter is only an intersection, not a complete selected-list schedule |

## Trakt and account data

| ID | Item | Status | Remaining work / acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| T01 | Device login, refresh, protected token store, HTTPS/session guards | Mocked/inactive; storage hardened (0.13) | Application registration, public ID/redirect URI, actual login/refresh and TV storage/TLS verification |
| T02 | Account connect/cancel/switch/disconnect UI | Controller and injected dialog adapter inactive (0.12); setup guidance implemented | Wire UI only after activation gates; verify revocation/privacy wording and recovery on TV |
| T03 | Personal/liked lists and saved account-bound selections | Mocked/inactive; storage and migration guards hardened (0.13) | Choose real lists and verify live account isolation, paging and restart behavior |
| T04 | Complete movie watched snapshot and filtered joins | Mocked/inactive (0.8) | Bounded full snapshot; no missing-response-to-unwatched fallback; live validation still pending |
| T05 | Live Trakt read views | Pending | Enable after registration, transport and device checks |
| T06 | Live history/list actions | Pending | Separate consent/outcome checks after reads; no automatic write retries |
| T07 | Persistent metadata cache, shared rate limiting and performance | Invocation-memory cache implemented; shared request limits implemented/inactive (0.9); persistent cache decision pending | Validate shared limits on TV; decide retention/invalidation and measure TV load times before live wiring |
| T08 | Wider public Trakt application access | Pending external approval | Service registration/Production requirements and current terms review |

## Real-Debrid

| ID | Item | Status | Remaining work / acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| D01 | Open-source device authorization and refresh contracts | Mocked/inactive | Register application; verify exact pending-authorization response on device; no bundled shared secret |
| D02 | Account/download/link-resolution contracts | Mocked/inactive | Validate service responses/entitlement with own account on TV; no title catalogue or discovery claim |
| D03 | Separate private credential store and durable refresh claims | Mocked/inactive (0.8) | Private SQLite and account-generation tests; actual Android permissions and recovery pending |
| D04 | Fixed-host bounded HTTPS/form transport | Mocked/inactive (0.8) | Injected connection tests; actual TLS/DNS/cancellation behavior pending |
| D05 | Session/login/refresh/read/resolve coordination | Mocked/inactive (0.8) | Joined store/transport tests and stale-response rejection; live activation pending |
| D06 | Real account UI and activation | Assembly, flow and dialog adapter inactive (0.12); live menu pending | Wire only after D01–D05 validation; cross-device quota coordination and disconnect/revocation UX remain |

## Sources and playback

| ID | Item | Status | Remaining work / acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| P01 | Authorized source input/discovery | Decision | Choose explicit supplied links and/or a reviewed source provider; metadata cannot substitute for sources |
| P02 | Umbrella handoff experiment | Pinned source/route/licence inspection complete (0.9); device handoff unverified | Verify installed version/provenance and supported interface, then movie/episode, cancellation, subtitles, resume and ownership tests; no adapter enabled |
| P03 | Native playback coordination | Mocked/inactive; event observer added (0.10) | Single-attempt dispatch and AV-start evidence separated; real Kodi adapter and dispatch/account ownership remain |
| P04 | Playback, subtitles, seek/resume, cancellation/errors | Pending TV validation | Validate actual AV start and end-to-end behavior with authorized media |
| P05 | Resume and Trakt scrobbling ownership | Decision / pending | Exactly one owner; start/pause/stop/completion and manual correction tests |
| P06 | Next aired episode / offer next aired unwatched | Demo choice implemented | Actual end-of-playback sequencing, watched reconciliation and cancellation |

## Distribution, quality and governance

| ID | Item | Status | Remaining work / acceptance |
|---|---|---|---|
| R01 | Reproducible manual ZIP and public Pages preview | Implemented; 0.12 publication and HTTP integrity verified | 0.13 publication follows merge; cloud checks do not prove TV installation |
| R02 | Repository package/index/checksums, retained packages and verifier | Implemented; experimental repository channel published (0.9) | 0.12 deployed-byte verification passed; clean repository-first install still needs TV evidence |
| R03 | Repository hosting, upgrades and rollback | Experimental Pages channel, immutable history and local release preparation implemented; HTTP verification passed; TV acceptance pending | Verify each new publication; test clean install/upgrade and documented rollback on TV |
| Q01 | Python 3.8/3.12, manifests/XML, packaging/repeatability checks | Implemented | Continue regression coverage; cloud tests never replace TV tests |
| Q02 | Weekly security/dependency/Action update checks and SHA pins | Implemented | Manual issue triage; no automatic update PRs or PR comments |
| Q03 | Full Kodi add-on checker, pinned linter, package hash lock | Pinned Ruff correctness gate and dependency hash locks implemented (0.9); official checker pending | Full checker blocked on reviewed secure/offline input and compatible repository schema; diagnostic schema checks are not a full pass |
| Q04 | Device readiness and sanitized test checklist | Implemented; optional synthetic private-storage check added (0.12); TV results pending | Provide safe version fields and observations; no full backup or secrets needed |
| G01 | Original-code licence | Decision | Existing MIT remains; final owner preference still unconfirmed |
| G02 | Third-party source/assets and service compliance | Ongoing gate | Verify exact licence/compatibility before reuse; no upstream source/assets copied |
| G03 | Public repository neutrality and secret hygiene | Implemented practice | Keep credentials/private watch data out of source, artifacts, logs and public discussion |

## Current combined batch: 0.13

Parallel scope: harden the existing Trakt credential and preference stores, protect
demo state reads and atomic saves from unsafe filesystem targets, and test the
assembled services against legacy stores and subsequent filesystem changes.
Valid saved credentials and list selections remain compatible. Malformed private
stores fail without automatic reset, deletion or a network fallback. See
[storage boundaries](storage-boundaries.md) for guarantees and limitations.
No real account, playback, scrobbling or persistent metadata cache is enabled;
Trakt mutation requests remain disabled in the assembly.

Video 0.12.0 and repository 0.2.0 deployed from merge commit
`4fbc5b3a34bfb76c5aac3fce5646814b82f7a7b0`. The
[publication run](https://github.com/susanto-dev/homefx/actions/runs/43349117123)
passed build, deployment and public-byte verification. HTTP checks never establish
Kodi installation or upgrade acceptance. This batch prepares video 0.13.0 and
preserves all six prior archive records and bytes.

## External inputs and decisions

The next useful device evidence is the readiness report and existing widget/navigation
checklist, followed by service-registration details (public IDs only). Real lists/views,
movie release region/type, first playback path, source-provider choice, scrobbling
ownership, final original-code licence and TV acceptance of repository updates/rollback remain open.
These inputs do not block the current mocked foundation work. Never send secrets,
account exports, watch history or a full Kodi backup.

NBA, a separate Android app and an always-on server are outside scope. A new skin is
a conditional future option, not a required component. See [playback plan](playback-plan.md),
[account gates](account-setup.md), [handoff evidence](umbrella-feasibility.md),
[metadata contracts](metadata-contract.md) and [TV checklist](testing-on-tv.md).
